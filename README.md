## Description
This is the Take Home Challenge from Vesperia as the first stage of the recruitment process for the position of software engineer.

## Features

- Dynamic display

## Technologies Used
- React.js for the client or front end
- Express.js for the server or back end
- Concurrently as a root package
- Moment.js for easier date and time management
- SweetAlert (swal) for alerts
- React Spinners for loading animations

## Ports
- Client: 4000
- Server: 3000

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/bagassandih/flickr-gallery.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the flickr-gallery directory:
    ```sh
    cd flickr-gallery
    ```
3. Install all dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
